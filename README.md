# Salt Net API

This is a very opinionated client for the Salt Net API. The data from the Salt API is honestly a mess and so this is my attempt to handle it better. 

There is a good chance this doesn't cover all use cases so I am open to some PR.

## Using

Really simply, it follows a very similar setup tha the python netapi does and also exposes some helper stuff


```
import {LocalClient} from "salt-net-api";
